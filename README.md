Submission for Team Abhiyaan
=====================================

Name:
Leon Davis M S 

Roll no:
ED21B038

Previous Experience

I've made a chess game using C language
I've made simple 2-D games using python like the chrome dinosaur game.

Current PORs:
None

Why I want to work in the team:

I love coding and solving real-world problems using my code. Electronics also interests me, but i'm more inclined towards the software part. I think self-driving cars will play a big part in the near future, and it excites me to have a chance to work in field thats somewhat new and unexplored. I also used to love drawing and designing cars(before JEE). I like the thought of spending days, and even weeks on a problem and getting the satisfaction of finally solving it. Building something as a team and showcasing it to the world also excites me alot. So, Abhiyaan seems like the obvious choice considering my interests and all the the things i'm passionate about. I would love to work with you guys.
